Digital eye strain (DES), also known as computer vision syndrome, encompasses a range of ocular and visual symptoms, and estimates suggest its prevalence may be 50% or more among computer users.

DES is typically broken down into two categories: 
1. Those linked to accomodative or binocular vision stress
2. Those linked to blue light fatigue

A range of treatment and/or corrections exist:
1. Correction of refractive error such as [[presbyopia]]
2. Management of [[dry eye]]
3. Incorporating regular screen breaks
4. Consideration of [[vergence]] and accommodative problems

Consideration of blue light filtered lenses has seen mixed results.
