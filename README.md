This is my note taking environment started on August 30, 2022.

Notes are synced to a git repo currently hosted on GitHub.

Notes are organized into folders based on their overarching topic.

For example: 
main/programming-concepts/..
main/learning-rust/..
main/new-car-research/..
main/ev-research/..
main/language-concepts/..

Folders adhere to kebab casing. Individual notes are titled by capitalized first character, with capitalization for proper nouns.

For example:

Managing TCP sockets across multiple threads
How to bake sourdough bread
Net-present-value approximation for depreciable assets
