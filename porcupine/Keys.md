# Keys

Keys are the core "concepts" associated with each data type in the project.

A key maps to a physical description of a thing. For example, there could be a key called "township", which maps to a physical geographical region. There could be a key called "person" which maps to a human being. There could be a key called "population" which maps to a group of human beings.

Keys can have possible relationships to other keys.
