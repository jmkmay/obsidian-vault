# Relationships

Relationships describe the interaction between two entities.

For example: a store entity can have a relationship of "IS_CUSTOMER" between the store and a person entity. A transaction can have the relationship  "HAS_PURCHASED" between a customer entity and the transaction entity.

A population entity can have "HAS_POPULATION" between a geographic entity and the population.
