# Entities

Keys are the core "concepts" associated with each data type in the project.

A entity maps to a physical description of a thing. For example, there could be a entity called "township", which maps to a physical geographical region. There could be a entity called "person" which maps to a human being. There could be a entity called "population" which maps to a group of human beings.

Entities can have possible relationships to other entities. 

Entities are almost always proper nouns.
