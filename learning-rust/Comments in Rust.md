# Comments in Rust

Comments in [[Rust]] are written inline with `//`

```rust
// on its own

fn main() {

	// inside a function
	let x = 5; // after a statement
}

// So we’re doing something complicated here, long enough that we need
// multiple lines of comments to do it! Whew! Hopefully, this comment will
// explain what’s going on.
```
