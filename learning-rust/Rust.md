[[Rust]] is a language developed by [[Mozilla]] to make managing concurrency and memory safety easier and more robust in a performant system level language.

It uses the concept of [[borrowing]] to facilitate memory safety, which essentially eliminates vectors for bugs such as [[dangling pointers]] and [[overflow]] vulnerabilities.

[[Rust]] uses an extremely robust [[compiler]] with unusually specific error correction. One of the most important aspects of the language is that its very strict in what is allowed to compile, but also does a good job at holding your hand at **fixing** compilation issues.

Rust is a ***very*** **opinionated** programming language. It introduces a different way of thinking about programming concepts through features such as [[traits]], [[macros]], [[smart pointers]], and [[pattern matching]]. These opinions are typically well thought out, however, and are the result of some very smart people trying to create a more enjoyable and effective programming experience.

The opininonated nature creates a larger barrier of entry- especially for people coming from higher level languages such as [[Python]], [[TypeScript]], or [[C#]].
